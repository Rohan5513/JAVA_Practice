## Introduction

This repository contains Java implementations of fundamental data structures. Each data structure is encapsulated within its own folder, containing the implementation code, along with comments explaining the logic and operations of the structure.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `LinkedList`: Implementation of a linked list data structure.

Each folder contains the Java files for the specific data structure, including supporting classes and utility functions.

## Implemented Data Structures

### LinkedList
The LinkedList folder contains code demonstrating the implementation of a basic linked list, featuring functionalities such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.



Happy coding!
